              Welcome to my world! I am your workout buddy Kelvin, and my story
              is not very different from yours. I started working out as an
              amateur while in high-school. Back then, we used to make weights
              out of concrete, which we would ‘play’ with in the fields during
              break time. The home-made gym equipment was our go-to since our
              head principle was against the idea of starting a gym at the
              school.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
              We improvised dumbbells, rollers, barbells, and hanging pull bars.
              As we enjoyed the idea of having big muscle, we would never miss
              our ‘gym sessions’ every time we had free time in our pockets.
              When I joined university for a BSc in biochemistry, I learned a
              lot regarding the processes that make the body the way it is. With
              my passion for building a physique still in me, I decided to join
              a gym club at the university. There, I found many people whom we
              shared similar stories of how they started working out, their
              goals, and many more. Now since I have always had a passion for
              writing, I decided to document my experiences, lessons, and also
              opinions – mine and from friends. I didn’t have a blog then, and a
              friend gave me the idea of starting one. And, that’s how The

                We all have different reasons why we started working out. Some
                were just fueled by the desire to look like Dwayne 'The Johnson,
